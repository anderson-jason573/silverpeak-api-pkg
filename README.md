# SilverPeak-functions

Collection of functions for Silver Peak API calls,
contained in a package called 'api'.

git alias = 'sp-api-pkg'

Notes:
     - All functions will be called from a 'main' script

Issues:
     - look at using classes to return multiple results of readYAML function.
     - add imports to each function, i.e. requests, os, yaml, base64, etc.
